<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, sign up for an OpenAI account and generate an API key. This key will allow you to access and utilize the OpenAI API effectively. Finally, clone the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command with the repository URL.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OwusuBlessing/Langchain-Project.git
```

### Prerequisites
To set up a virtual environment, you can choose to use either Python's built-in virtual environment tools or Anaconda, depending on your preference. Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory. From there, create your virtual environment using your preferred method
* Using Python's venv Module write the following command one after the other:
  ```sh
  python -m venv myenv
  
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  
  source myenv/bin/activate

  ```
  

* Using Anaconda write the following command one after the other:
  ```sh
  conda create --name myenv
  
  conda activate myenv
  ```


### Installation


1. Get your API Key at [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OwusuBlessing/Langchain-Project.git
   ```
3. Install packages after activating your virtual environment and run:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Enter your API in `.env`
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY="ENTER YOUR API"
   ```
