The\\n\\ntadpole hatches in a few days to a week or more and\\n\\nmetamorphoses into a frog within two months to three years. During\\n\\nmetamorphosis the lungs develop, limbs appear, the tail is absorbed, and the\\n\\nmouth becomes typically froglike.

By 2019 the\\n\\nspecies had lost up to 75 percent of its former range. Several large pockets, however, remained throughout sub-Saharan Africa,\\n\\nIran, and the\\n\\nHimalayas, with smaller pockets scattered throughout Central Asia, India,\\n\\nSoutheast Asia, eastern China and Manchuria, and the Korean peninsula. In addition, one tiny pocket of leopards\\n\\npersists in the\\n\\nAtlas Mountains.\\n\\nBritannica Quiz\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAnimal Group Names\\n\\nNatural history\\n\\nThe leopard varies greatly in size and markings. The average size is 50 to 90 kg (110 to 200 pounds) in weight, 210 cm (84 inches), excluding the 90-cm tail, in length, and 60 to 70 cm in shoulder height. The leopard can, however, grow much larger. The ground colour is typically yellowish above and white below. Dark spots are generally arranged in rosettes over much of the body and are without the central spot characteristic of the coat of the jaguar; the ground colour within the rosettes is sometimes a darker yellow, and the size and spacing of the spots vary greatly. As a result of these differences in pattern, several races of leopard have been named.\\n\\nleopard\\n\\nsolitary\\n\\nanimal of the bush and forest and is mainly nocturnal in habit, although it sometimes basks in the sun. It is an agile climber and frequently stores the remains of its kills in the branches of a\\n\\ntree. It feeds upon any animals it can overpower, from small\\n\\nrodents to\\n\\nwaterbuck, but generally preys on the smaller and medium-sized\\n\\nantelopes and\\n\\ndeer; it appears to have a special liking for\\n\\ndogs as food and, in Africa, for baboons. It sometimes takes\\n\\nlivestock and may attack\\n\\nhuman beings.\\n\\nleopard\\n\\nThere is no definite breeding season; the female produces two to four, usually three, cubs after a gestation period of about three months. The calls of the leopard vary and include a series of harsh coughs, throaty growls, and deep purring sounds. The animal takes to water readily and is a good swimmer.\\n\\nSee the endangered Amur leopard roaming in the boreal forests of eastern Russia\\n\\nSee all videos for this article\\n\\nA black form, in which the ground colour as well as the spots is black, is widely known as the black panther; it is more common in Asia than in other parts of the range of the leopard.

By 2019 the\\n\\nspecies had lost up to 75 percent of its former range. Several large pockets, however, remained throughout sub-Saharan Africa,\\n\\nIran, and the\\n\\nHimalayas, with smaller pockets scattered throughout Central Asia, India,\\n\\nSoutheast Asia, eastern China and Manchuria, and the Korean peninsula. In addition, one tiny pocket of leopards\\n\\npersists in the\\n\\nAtlas Mountains.\\n\\nBritannica Quiz\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAnimal Group Names\\n\\nNatural history\\n\\nThe leopard varies greatly in size and markings. The average size is 50 to 90 kg (110 to 200 pounds) in weight, 210 cm (84 inches), excluding the 90-cm tail, in length, and 60 to 70 cm in shoulder height. The leopard can, however, grow much larger. The ground colour is typically yellowish above and white below. Dark spots are generally arranged in rosettes over much of the body and are without the central spot characteristic of the coat of the jaguar; the ground colour within the rosettes is sometimes a darker yellow, and the size and spacing of the spots vary greatly. As a result of these differences in pattern, several races of leopard have been named.\\n\\nleopard\\n\\nsolitary\\n\\nanimal of the bush and forest and is mainly nocturnal in habit, although it sometimes basks in the sun. It is an agile climber and frequently stores the remains of its kills in the branches of a\\n\\ntree. It feeds upon any animals it can overpower, from small\\n\\nrodents to\\n\\nwaterbuck, but generally preys on the smaller and medium-sized\\n\\nantelopes and\\n\\ndeer; it appears to have a special liking for\\n\\ndogs as food and, in Africa, for baboons. It sometimes takes\\n\\nlivestock and may attack\\n\\nhuman beings.\\n\\nleopard\\n\\nThere is no definite breeding season; the female produces two to four, usually three, cubs after a gestation period of about three months. The calls of the leopard vary and include a series of harsh coughs, throaty growls, and deep purring sounds. The animal takes to water readily and is a good swimmer.\\n\\nSee the endangered Amur leopard roaming in the boreal forests of eastern Russia\\n\\nSee all videos for this article\\n\\nA black form, in which the ground colour as well as the spots is black, is widely known as the black panther; it is more common in Asia than in other parts of the range of the leopard. The races known as the Barbary, South Arabian, Anatolian, Amur, and Sinai leopards are listed as endangered.\\n\\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.\\n\\nSubscribe Now\\n\\nThe lion, tiger, and jaguar also belong to the genus Panthera.
